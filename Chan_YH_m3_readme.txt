vi. The game has two team, red and blue team.  Each team is equipped with two players.  The four main states in the game Is GETBALL, SHOOT, HIDE, PRISON, the function is as the named state indicated.  A player will choose to rescue its teammate who is in prison over shooting the ball to enemy.  When shooting to enemy, the shooting function is equipped with a +/- 5 in the x direction.  The value is added to the target point in random to increase the difficulty of the game.  So if you see the ball is not throwing directly toward an enemy, it is not a bug.  When all member of a team is in prison, the game is over.  When game is over, a text at either lower left or right corner will display depends on which team wins.  The game will not restart after winning.  Ball spawn in designated location only, if it hasn’t been picking up for a while, it will disappear.
